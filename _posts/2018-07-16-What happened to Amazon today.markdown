As **someone** who do his **PhD** studies, It's completely hard to manage that time between everyone including your family, friends, research staff and having fun enjoying life.
What I noticed from my experience is that I was not managing my time efficiently and in glance here are the things from mindtools that I should start thinking about:

Mistake #1:  Try Keep a To-Do List

Mistake #2:  Set Personal Goals and strategies to reach those goals

Mistake #3:  Prioritizing your objects.

Mistake #4:  No procrastination

So maybe we maybe it is not that bad
