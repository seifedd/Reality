As **Amazon** prepares for the  *second biggest shopping event of the year* after *Black Friday* in July, the company promises its customers with plenty of `deals and offers`. Many has been saving already for this event (honestly not me, I don't know anything about saving!) and prepared to do the shopping for many products that will be on huge discount.


What happened is that Amazon is experiencing some trouble to manage all those users and it only took a couple of minutes before the hole server crunches and some users are not able to benefits from these "huge shopping deals". Very sad!
