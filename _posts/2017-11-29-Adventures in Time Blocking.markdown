People have ideas, but don’t remember them. 

What you need is a Spark File.

The basic idea is this:

    Whenever you have a hunch or idea, put them together in remind. And don't judge them, don't think about them, just put them in there. And wait for the right time to grab them. Maybe one day that idea can become true. Who knows! 


    Put a recurring calendar event - every 2-3 months (take your pick) seems like a good pace.

Return to your spark file every time that event comes up. Re-read the whole thing, from start to finish.

Who knows - maybe you’ll start to see a pattern of ideas around a topic. Or you’ll see things that can fit together in a blog post.
