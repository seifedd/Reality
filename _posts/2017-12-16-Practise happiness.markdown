Money can not buy happiness. We are all familiar with this saying. But do we really believe in this especially nowadays in time where everyone may dream of having a palace or a beatifull house, a beautifull housewive or husband (in short a beautifull of everything!!) and yet still missing something. haha :p

The most of us would still be left feeling unfulfilled even if we have all of these, as if something is srill missing from our lives.

Even if you do not feel happy, or do not feel as if you can simply decide to be happy, you can practice happiness. Make conscious decisions every day to choose to be as happy as you can be. `Pick positive things to say about yourself`, `choose positive thoughts`, and `eliminate old patterns of negative, depressing thoughts`. The more you do this, and the more effort you put into it each day, `the easier it can be to actually become happy. Yes, you can practice being happy to become happy!` What a wonderful concept.
